Inventory Management with Docker & CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Project Summary:
As part of a real-world inventory management system project, I developed a full-stack application that integrates Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment. The project aims to provide efficient management and deployment of inventory data across different environments, ensuring scalability, security, and streamlined updates.

Key Technologies Used:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Frontend: React.js (for the management interface)
Containerization: Docker for creating and managing isolated environments
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration
Achievements:

Built and deployed a Spring Boot-based API for managing inventory data, including CRUD operations and user authentication.
Containerized the application using Docker to create isolated, consistent environments across local, staging, and production.
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, automating the deployment of changes to the application to Docker Hub and AWS.
Developed a secure and scalable deployment process with automatic updates and rollback mechanisms.
Key Learnings:

Hands-on experience with Docker for building, testing, and deploying applications in isolated containers.
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
Managed application security, including configuring Docker authentication and resolving issues with access tokens and permissions.
Gained a deeper understanding of version control systems and workflows with GitHub, including branch management, pull requests, and version tagging.
