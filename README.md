Inventory Management with Docker & CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Project Summary:
As part of a real-world inventory management system project, I developed a full-stack application that integrates Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment. The project aims to provide efficient management and deployment of inventory data across different environments, ensuring scalability, security, and streamlined updates.

Key Technologies Used:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot
Frontend: React.js (for the management interface)
Containerization: Docker for creating and managing isolated environments
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration
Achievements:

Built and deployed a Spring Boot-based API for managing inventory data, including CRUD operations and user authentication.
Containerized the application using Docker to create isolated, consistent environments across local, staging, and production.
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, automating the deployment of changes to the application to Docker Hub and AWS.
Developed a secure and scalable deployment process with automatic updates and rollback mechanisms.
Key Learnings:

Hands-on experience with Docker for building, testing, and deploying applications in isolated containers.
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
Managed application security, including configuring Docker authentication and resolving issues with access tokens and permissions.
Gained a deeper understanding of version control systems and workflows with GitHub, including branch management, pull requests, and version tagging.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

1. Why did you use Docker in this project?
I used Docker to create a "container" for the application, which is like a mini, self-contained environment that holds everything the app needs to run. This makes it easy to run the app on different machines (like your local computer or a cloud server) without worrying about missing software or settings. It ensures the app works the same everywhere.

2. What is the significance of CI/CD in this project?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It helps automate the process of building, testing, and releasing the app. Whenever I make changes to the code, CI/CD ensures the app is automatically tested and deployed without manual effort. This makes it faster and more reliable to release updates to the app.

3. How did you handle Docker authentication and push to Docker Hub?
I used Docker Hub’s login system to authenticate (like logging in to an account). To securely push the app's Docker image to Docker Hub, I used a special access key (Personal Access Token or PAT). This key made sure I had permission to upload the app without anyone else being able to do it.

4. How did you address issues with Docker Hub access tokens or permissions?
Sometimes, the access key didn’t have the right permissions, so I had to create a new one with the correct settings to allow uploading the app. I also learned how to store the key securely and use it in a safer way, without exposing it to others.

5. How did you ensure that the application runs smoothly across all environments?
Using Docker meant that the app was always in the same environment, no matter where it ran (your computer, staging server, or production). This reduces issues like "it works on my machine" because the app always has the same setup, making it easier to move the app through different stages without problems.
